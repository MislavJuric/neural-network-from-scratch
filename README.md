# Neural Network from Scratch

Neural network implementation from scratch (in Python) I made by following the guide at: http://www.code-spot.co.za/2009/10/08/15-steps-to-implemented-a-neural-net/. Besides "regular" Python, I only used NumPy, matplotlib and pandas.

The code is contained in **Neural Network from Scratch.ipynb**. **data** directory contains the data the neural network is trained on. **environment.yml** is the file you can use to re-create my local Python environment in [(Ana)conda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

As I state in the *Epilogue* in **Neural Network from Scratch.ipynb**, I didn't comprehensively check the notebook for logical errors. If there's any, feel free to point it out to me. **Neural Network from Scratch.ipynb** also contains *Deprecated code* at its end; it's some code that I wrote that I do not use. I kept it as backup and for (potential) future reference.
